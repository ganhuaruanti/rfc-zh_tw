# Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels

## Status of this Memo

This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the
Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
improvements.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

## 大綱

In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
RFC 2119.

Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement
level of the document in which they are used.

## 1. 必須（MUST）   

「必須」，或者「需要」（REQUIRED），「將會」（SHALL），代表該項目是規格的必要需求。

## 2. 絕對不可／絕對不能（MUST NOT）   

「絕對不可／絕對不能」，或者「將不會」（SHALL NOT），代表該項目是規格絕對禁止的項目。

## 3. 應該（SHOULD）   

This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there
may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a
particular item, but the full implications must be understood and
carefully weighed before choosing a different course.

## 4. 不該（SHOULD NOT）

This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that
there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the
particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full
implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed
before implementing any behavior described with this label.

## 5. 可以（MAY）   

「可以」，或者形容詞「非強制的」（OPTIONAL），代表該項目是非強制的。如果符合特定商業需求，或者單純覺得可以提升產品，公司可以選擇實作或者忽略該項目。

This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is
truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item because a
particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that
it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item.
An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be
prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does
include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the
same vein an implementation which does include a particular option
MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which
does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the
option provides.)

## 6. Guidance in the use of these 祈使語

Imperatives of the type defined in this memo must be used with care
and sparingly.  In particular, they MUST only be used where it is
actually required for interoperation or to limit behavior which has
potential for causing harm (e.g., limiting retransmisssions)  For
example, they must not be used to try to impose a particular method
on implementors where the method is not required for
interoperability.

## 7. 安全性考量

These terms are frequently used to specify behavior with security
implications.  The effects on security of not implementing a MUST or
SHOULD, or doing something the specification says MUST NOT or SHOULD
NOT be done may be very subtle. Document authors should take the time
to elaborate the security implications of not following
recommendations or requirements as most implementors will not have
had the benefit of the experience and discussion that produced the
specification.

## 8. 致謝

The definitions of these terms are an amalgam of definitions taken
from a number of RFCs.  In addition, suggestions have been
incorporated from a number of people including Robert Ullmann, Thomas
Narten, Neal McBurnett, and Robert Elz.
